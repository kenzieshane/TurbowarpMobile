## Yet another experimental Turbowarp 'port' for Android (and iOS?) using cordova

Basically I pulled using git Turbowarp/scratch-gui and compiled it--then chuck it in cordova--then yeah, compiled it again to an apk. Cordova allows you to export to .aab and or .apk, and also allows for much flexible front-end editing if you want to contribute and actually make a suitable gui for phones, but for tablets i assume this is already fantastic. I know it is crappy for now but i might update it later!

What works:
- Making a Project, standard editor feature
- Works offline

What doesn't work
- Saving projects
- Doesn't work online

What untested
- iOS support
  
Put an issue to advice what else work/doesn't work or features you want!
